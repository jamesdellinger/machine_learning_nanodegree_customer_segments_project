For Udacity's [Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) Nanodegree.

Topic: Unsupervised Learning.

## Overview
* I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.
* This information will help the distributor tailor its delivery services to meet the needs of its different types of customers, all while minimizing costs.
* The dataset contains spending records across six product categories for 440 customers of a wholesale grocery distributor. It comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers).

## Concepts
* Applying preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
* Interpreting data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
* Analyzing PCA dimensions in order to construct a new feature space.
* Ascertaining whether my clustering algorithm has optimally clustered a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset:
  * Using mean silhouette coefficient to determine the best number of clusters.
  * Comparing the performance, capabilities and limitations of algorithms like K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM).
  * Visualizing clusters with matplotlib.
* Assessing information given by cluster data and using it in a meaningful way.
